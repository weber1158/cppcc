This repository contains my personal solutions to selected exercises from
"C++ Crash Course" by Josh Lospinoso (https://ccc.codes/).

The solutions are independently written and do not include the original
exercise text or companion source code. References to exercises are limited
to identifiers (e.g., chapter or exercise numbers).
